Development log for my offline cognitive AI, Kortana (450MB semantic engine).


Kortana Development Log

This is the development logbook for my personal AI project “Kortana.”

In this repository I keep track of:
	•	daily or weekly notes
	•	observations during development
	•	tests I run
	•	ideas and insights I want to preserve

Please note:
	•	This is not Kortana’s source code
	•	This is not technical documentation
	•	Only my own development notes and progress

Why does this logbook exist?
	•	To record my progress
	•	To revisit patterns later
	•	To potentially create a paper, blog, or document in the future
	•	To be transparent about my learning process

Everything in this repository is purely informative and experimental.
