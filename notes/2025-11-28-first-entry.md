2025-11-28 — Start of the Kortana Logbook

Today I decided to begin an official development log for my personal AI project, Kortana.
i started this project in june 2025, had a tough time going through the start. i do not know how to code, nowadays i do a little better.
Today i decided to log my progress because of the complexity the project is getting in to.
I still think I am on track, the first few promising tests are getting along, tagging seems okay now, clustering is hard to understand, I think I have fixed most issues with that.

This repository will serve as a simple place to record:
	•	observations during development
	•	ideas that arise while building
	•	tests and prototype behavior
	•	interesting patterns I want to track over time

Current status (high level):
	•	The general meaning pipeline is functional
	•	Basic tag → cluster → supercluster mapping works
	•	Early emotional inference tests show promising signals
	•	The memory and reconstruction layers run, though still unstable
	•	Several components need refinement, especially in consistency and integration

Nothing here reflects the full architecture or implementation.
This log is only meant to document my personal progress while building a compact, offline, cognitive-style AI system.

More entries will follow as development continues.
